# Day 4 - Fixing Numpy{/scipy/matplotlib}

Work in groups (approx 3-6 per group)
Browse the Numpy bug list which I will post
Select a bug which you think that you can work on
Clear it with me

Fork (not clone) the Numpy repository to your own account on GitHub
Clone your copy of Numpy to your computer

Try to figure out what the Bug Issue really means
What is the desired behaviour?
Why is it not working?
Is there a proposed solution?
Does it really solve the problem?
Is the proposed solution consistent with the wider Numpy project?!

Check the standards of the project to which you are submitting. Sometimes they prefer a certain format of text in the commit.

Create a new branch to work on your proposed bug fix
>>>> git checkout -b new_branch_name

Write a test (before you write the bug fix; this way you'll know if it works)
Write the bug fix

Do not submit a Pull Request unless you are confident that your new code fits the project.


Numpy:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/dev/development_environment.html

In main repository folder, run:
python runtests.py -v -t subdirectory/test_filename.py:test_function_name
to only run specific tests.


Matplotlib:
http://matplotlib.org/devel/coding_guide.html#testing

For compiling Matplotlib, you need:
conda install freetype
conda install pkg-config
conda uninstall matplotlib

Finally,
python setup.py install
in the matplotlib folder.
